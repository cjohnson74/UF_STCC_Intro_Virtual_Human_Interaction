# UF STCC Intro Virtual Human Interaction Task
This is my Intro Virtual Human Interaction Task to help me get familiar with the technologies used by The University of Florida’s STEM Translational Communication Center (STCC). 

#

### What am I doing?
My task is to select a topic from the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) YouTube:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVdFy0DLWhIApG8LWDzV1w, and create a virtual human interaction to convey this information.

### Who am I doing this for?
I have to think of a group of people I am very familiar with that you can deliver this information to. I chose the black community to focus on how I could best cater this information.

### How will I do it?
I will be transforming the video topic I choose into an interaction with a virtual human to convey the information. In addition, I will tailor the way the information is delivered as if addressing a specific group of people (ie, How can I change the way the virtual human delivers this information based on the target audience?)
I will use one of our existing virtual human creation pipelines.
