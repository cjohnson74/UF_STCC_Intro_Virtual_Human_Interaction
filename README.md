# UF STCC Intro Virtual Human Interaction
This is my Intro Virtual Human Interaction Task to help me get familiar with the technologies used by The University of Florida’s STEM Translational Communication Center (STCC). 

### What am I doing?
Your task is to select a topic from the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) YouTube:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVdFy0DLWhIApG8LWDzV1w, and create a virtual human interaction to convey this information.

### Who am I doing this for?
That depends! Think of a group of people you are very familiar with (ex, members of your church, baristas at your favorite coffee shop, an elderly population, hospital staff, etc!) that you can deliver this information to.

### How will I do it?
You will be transforming the video topic you choose into an interaction with a virtual human to convey the information. In addition, you will tailor the way the information is delivered as if addressing a specific group of people (ie, imagine this virtual human is conveying this information to members of church, or hospital staff, or an elderly population — how can you change the way the virtual human delivers this information based on the target audience?)
You will use one of our existing virtual human creation pipelines.
